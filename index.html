        July 31: I have always wanted to make something involving programming, and look at that, I'm starting to do it! Here, we will provide all the information we have on certain empires, wars, kingdoms, and provide updates when possible. We soon will have records of countries, their own wars, and more is planned for this website. I hope all that use this finds it extremely helpful! The founding date of this was July 31, 2024, and I will continue to push out updates. Oh yes, this is also my first HTML project, then my plans are to learn CSS, maybe JS, and then I'll try and make programs! Cya, Dylan, out.</p>

    VER 1.0 UPDATE
  </p>
    <p class="tClass, bClass">
        Aug 2: This isn't really an update but I just wanted to say that we have now added a Country List! It will be linked in this page, have a great time with what's currently in it, it's not very good at all and everything is kind of messy but we tried our best!</p>   
  <p>
    VER 1.2 UPDATE
  </p>
    <p class="bClass">
        Aug 4: Woah it's gonna be VER 1.3 soon?!?!?!? That is crazy. But the first change I have done was I made the text on this page a little bit bigger and changed the font with CSS, if you look in Github there will be a CSS file currently known as "test.css" (its now additive.css) I don't really know what to call it but currently I think I'll just keep it like that! It's still Aug 2 and it's been a while since I rolled out the last update which I added a new logo which is pretty good! It's the second logo, the first one had the same text as the new one but the new one has a new style and the order of the text is different! We're gonna add CSS in the next update, as I learn it! I hope it will look nice haha. I also maybe think that <abbr>BTWW</abbr> should be an abbreviation for "Bellum: The War Wiki"? Anyways, that's all for Aug 2, this is way too much text haha. Cyaaaaa!!!
    Aug 4: Sorry for the wait!
</p>
  <p>
    VER 1.3 UPDATE
</p>
    <p class="bClass">
        Aug 4: WOAH IT'S GONNA BE 1.4 THATS CRAZY!!! hi everyone!! so I think the most obvious thing I did is I added some margin and made everything look kinda clean!!
        Aug 7: I'm gonna make the design a bit cleaner!
        Aug 8: Alright, I think i'm gonna release it today. Everything looks clean now. Sorry for removing the Country List, but it was too much work and I was stressing out about it! Maybe in another update! CYA!
