    <p>I have always wanted to make something involving programming, and look at that, I'm starting to do it! Here, we will provide all the information we have on certain empires, wars, kingdoms, and provide updates when possible. We soon will have records of countries, their own wars, and more is planned for this website. I hope all that use this finds it extremely helpful! The founding date of this was July 31, 2024, and I will continue to push out updates. Oh yes, this is also my first HTML project, then my plans are to learn CSS, maybe JS, and then I'll try and make programs! Cya, Dylan, out.</p>
<p>VER 1.0 UPDATE</p>
