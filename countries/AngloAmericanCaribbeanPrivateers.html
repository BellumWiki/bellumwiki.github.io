    <p>The Anglo American Caribbean Privateers are a group of Caribbean pirates that don't have much information about them. They took place in the Civil War of the Post-Spanish Succession Caribbean Piracy in Britain, and were mostly demolished during that war and after, which marked the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. Again, not much are known about these pirates, but all we currently know is that they were mostly demolished in 1726. We don't know all the wars they were involved in, either. I will update this page if I find any further information on this group of pirates.  </p>
