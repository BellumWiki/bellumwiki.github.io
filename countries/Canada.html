<h2>Residential and Aboriginal history in Canada</h2>
<p class="tClass, bClass">There are tons of Indigenous tribes in Canada, such as the Mi'kmaq, the Anishinaabe, the Blackfoot, and more (a map will be shown under this text) but when the British came over to the tribes, they wanted to teach them how to "behave like normal people". This caused them to put indigenous children into Residential Schools, where they were beaten, stripped of their original clothing, and taught to completely disregard their own languages and learn English. They also taught Christianity in the schools, taught to disregard their original religions and forced other religions on them. They also stripped them from their parents for as long as a year, and pretty much traumatized them into being what they thought was "normal". The last Residential School was shut down in the mid-late 1990's, leaving the time that residential schools existed was from 1831 - 1996.</p>
